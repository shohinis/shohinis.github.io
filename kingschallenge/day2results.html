	<p class="prose">The scale wobbles back and forth, and even though this happened just yesterday you are still nervous. Yesterday everybody was quiet, but this time they are all shouting which side they think is going to be heavier. It's very overwhelming, and you are getting a headache so you close your eyes for a second.<br><br>
	<span id="left-heavier" style="display: none;">
		The shouting turns to cheers, and you open your eyes to see that <b>the left side is heavier than the right</b>. Half of the court looks excited, and the other is disappointed. They seem to have been placing bets on which is heavier. The guards lead you back to your room, and you start planning for the third and final weighing.

	<span id="balanced-scale" style="display: none;">
		The shouting turns to groans, and you open your eyes to see that the scale has stopped with the scales level. The scientists approach again to confirm, and the king rolls his eyes. The scientists announce that <b>the left and right sides are equal in weight</b>. None of the audience is happy; they all clearly forgot that the two sides could weigh the same. Perhaps you are smarter even though they grew up in the city. The guards lead you back to your room, and you start planning for the third and final weighing.
